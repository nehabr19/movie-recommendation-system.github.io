# movie-recommendation-system.github.io
This movie recommendation project employs web scraping to extract IMDb's top 250 movies data, enabling users to input a movie name and receive recommendations for similar films directed by the same individual.


Note: Websites frequently undergo changes, so the data scraped may become unusable if the website alters its structure, layout, or content.
