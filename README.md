# movie-recommendation-system.github.io
This movie recommendation project employs web scraping to extract IMDb's top 250 movies data, enabling users to input a movie name and receive recommendations for similar films directed by the same individual.


Note: Websites frequently undergo changes, so the data scraped may become unusable if the website alters its structure, layout, or content.

The name of the director is first acquired by web scraping from the IMDb website. Later, the best movies of the director are scraped and displayed on the screen.
